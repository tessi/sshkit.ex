# SSHKit

SSHKit is an Elixir toolkit for performing tasks on one or more servers,
built on top of Erlangâ€™s SSH application.

[Documentation for SSHKit is available online](https://hexdocs.pm/sshkit).

## Usage (work in progress)

SSHKit is designed to enable server task automation in a structured and
repeatable way, e.g. in the context of deployment tools:

```elixir
hosts = ["1.eg.io", {"2.eg.io", port: 2222}]

context =
  SSHKit.context(hosts)
  |> SSHKit.path("/var/www/phx")
  |> SSHKit.user("deploy")
  |> SSHKit.group("deploy")
  |> SSHKit.umask("022")
  |> SSHKit.env(%{"NODE_ENV" => "production"})

:ok = SSHKit.upload(context, ".", recursive: true)
:ok = SSHKit.run(context, "yarn install")
```

The [`SSHKit`](https://hexdocs.pm/sshkit/SSHKit.html) module documentation has more guidance and examples for the DSL.
If you need more control, take a look at the `SSHKit.SSH` and `SSHKit.SCP`
modules.

## Installation

You can use SSHKit in your projects in two steps:

1. Add `sshkit` to your `mix.exs` dependencies:

  ```elixir
  def deps do
    [{:sshkit, "~> 0.0.2"}]
  end
  ```

2. List `sshkit` in your application dependencies:

  ```elixir
  def application do
    [applications: [:sshkit]]
  end
  ```

## Testing

As usual run `mix test` to run the tests.
We also have functional tests to test "the real thing" on a docker machine.
Therefore, you'll need to have docker installed (also docker-machine if you're on OS X/Windows).

Since these functional tests take precious time.
You may want to not run them during development:

```bash
mix test --exclude functional
```
